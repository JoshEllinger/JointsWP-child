## To install:
1. Install JointsWp theme in the appropriate directory
1. Install JointsWp-child in the appropriate directory


### To install grunt functionality
1. install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
1. install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) if you havent already done this by using the command ``` npm install -g grunt-cli ```
1. run npm install inside the JointsWP-child directory


The gruntfile is pre-set up to work with zurb foundation, [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass), and live-reload.
If you use grunt watch, and live reload, you can build your sass files (using the super fast libsass)
and live preview your work as you go.
